Linear Regression
    Simple Linear Regressio
    Multiple Linear Regression
    Polynomial Regression
    Ridge & Lasso Regression - When thereâ€™s a risk of overfitting due to too many features we use these type of regression algorithms.
    Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    Decision Tree Regression
    Random Forest Regression - ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and each tree is trained on a different subset of the training data.
Classification Problem solution
    Linear Classifiers:
        Logistic Regression
            Binomial Logistic Regression
            Multinomial Logistic Regression
            Ordinal Logistic Regression -Examples include ratings like "low," "medium" and "high." It takes the order of the categories into account when modeling.
